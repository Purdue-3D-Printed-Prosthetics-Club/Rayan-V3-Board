This is an example schematic from Ben Miller's Senior Design Team.

The board uses an ESP32, CP2102N usb-uart bridge, and a Pololu Buck Converter

I recomend using a EXTERNAL BRIDGE - to reduce complexity if hand soldering

If not hand soldering keep the bridge.

You also could use a LDO rather than a buck converter, but the buck will be more power efficient
